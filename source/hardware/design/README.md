## Design

Parts originally designed in Solidworks. If you are doing changes to the design use Parasolid or STEP files. 

If you are 3d printing use the 3MF mesh files. (no STL files. filesize too big, no instancing of parts, no geometric validataion, can have holes etc, or not be water tight)

All units of mesurement are in milimeters (mm).
