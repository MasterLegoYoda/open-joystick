# Electrical
Electrical will consist of 2 main sections: the grip and Base. 


## Grip
Electrical on the grip will mostly consist of button based inputs.

### Inputs:
- buttons
- switches

### Outputs:
- LEDs


## Base
Base will have 3 rotational inputs and 4 outputs to electromagnetic coils. 

### Inputs:
- 3 rotational sensors per-axis (Possibly use potentiometers as hall effect sensors will have interference with coils)

### Outputs:
- 4 high current electromagnets.
