The work will be divided into the following main sections.

## [Mechanical](mechanical)
- All cams and pivots moving on ball bearings.
- Force feedback using brushless DC (BLDC) motors.
- A parametric grip to change from left and right varients as well as size. Possible different layouts etc. 

### [Design](mechanical/design)
- Info on 3d design of the hardware.

## [Electrical](electrical)
- 23 steps/degree capacitive encoders on the BLDC motors
- ODrive motor driver.
- All logic will be done using microcontrollers in the Arduino ecosystem. 

## [Software](software)
- Arduino based joystick implementation.
- Custom drivers (possibly)
- Plugin for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 if it's necessary to extract data to drive the force-feedback loop.

## [firmware](firmware)
