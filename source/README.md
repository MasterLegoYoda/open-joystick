Here all areas are broken down into sections

# Sections
The work will be divided into the following main sections.

## [Hardware](hardware)
- All cams and pivots moving on ball bearings.
- Force feedback using electromagnetic induction.
- A parametric grip to change from left and right varients as well as size. Possible different layouts etc. 

## [Electrical](electrical)
- Initially was going to be potentiometer based due to electromagnetic interference but will have another look at using hall effect sensors. 
- All logic will be done using microcontrollers in the Arduino ecosystem. 

## [Software](software)
- Arduino based joystick implementation.
- Custom drivers (possibly)
- Plugin for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 if it's necessary to extract data to drive the force-feedback loop.
