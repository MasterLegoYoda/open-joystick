# Open Joystick

Open Joystick is an open source joystick that is built out of off the shelf components and 3d printed parts. It will feature a 3-axis gimbal base, force feedback using electromagnets, left, right handed, multiple sized grips. The plan is to build a very robust joystick that is easily customizable and serviceable that includes many features only found on very high-end ones. 

# Progress
This project is still in the very early stages of planning and design. Currently there is a design for 3-axis gimbals using dual cam’s on PITCH and ROLL and a single cam for YAW. Force-feedback with Coils has an initial design but not finalized.

Below are progress updates from Youtube. 

### P3 | 3d printed Joystick (open joystick) - Twist axis improvements, M5 bolts
This iteration I have gotten the twist assembly in a state where I think it should work.
I have changed all the fasteners over to M5 bolts in standardized lengths. In the previous version there was some intersections with the base
Other major things improved in this version is separating the main assembly into 3 sub assemblies. This helps as the design becomes more complex.

### P2 | 3d printed Joystick (open joystick) - Twist axis, electromagnetic force feedback

The grip attaches to the upper twist assembly through 2 bearings (the big and small one). This should give enough contact for the grip to not wobble around. 

I have used the cams way of adding tension to the twist and it has added alot of bulk to the entire mechanism. Not sure if it’s entirely worth doing. The profile of the cams for the twist axis will need further adjusting as the tension doesn’t look like it’ll ramp up enough. The twist cams are meant to be tensioned by a spring that connects below.

### P1 | 3d printed Joystick (open joystick) - Gimbal design, assembly motion.
This video shows basically the full assembly of the original design by olukelo. Some minor changes were made where parts had interference with each other. Cam springs/elastic bands not visualized in this assembly.
